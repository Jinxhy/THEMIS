    "Our objective is to construct Python classes that accurately represent the data structures defined within TensorFlow Lite Flatbuffer files. Achieving this requires the following dependencies:\n",
    " - The `flatc` compiler: Responsible for generating ***Model Informative Classes*** from the text schema describing the model format.\n",
    " - The text schema: Defines the data structure of the model format\n",
    " - The Flatbuffer Python library: Serves as the runtime dependency for the generated accessor classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the `flatc` compiler is not available as a prebuilt binary and must be compiled from source. To ensure compatibility, the compiler version must align precisely with the Flatbuffer Python library version installed on the system. A mismatch between these versions can result in generated code that fails due to API inconsistencies. For this work, we use the Flatbuffer Python library version 1.12.0. Therefore, we acquire the source code for the flatc compiler by downloading the GitHub snapshot tagged with version 1.12.0, ensuring version consistency across all components. This setup guarantees functional and reproducible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remark: The latest versions of the Flatbuffer Python library and the `flatc` compiler can be used as well, but consistency between the two versions must be ensured to maintain functionality."
